title: Neonatal Web Interface
author: Alexandra Nickel, Eliot Raynor, Alex Vogel
abstract: Accurately tracking neonatal infant health and com-municating concerns between parents and clinicians is challenging during the early months of life. There is a clear need for an application that reduces reliance on parental memory and offers both clinicians and families a longitudinal view of an infant’s well-being. The pro-posed system is a web-based application with an SQL backend, an HTML front end, and Python backend handling SQL queries and decision support logic. Each infant has a profile that aggregates clinician entered vitals with parent entered observations like sleep and feeding times as well as flagged concerns. Core features include role-based logins for parents and doctors, time-series tracking of vital and behavioral data, automatic flagging of patterns that may indicate risk, integrated messaging to facilitate timely communication, and deci-sion support components that compares reported is-sues against a database of common conditions to help distinguish normal variation from potential problems.
